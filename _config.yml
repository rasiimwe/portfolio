  Iâ€™m interested in developing computational tools and applying statistical methods, and cutting-edge technologies (including machine learning and artificial intelligence) for integrating, managing and analyzing high-dimensional omics data to unravel true associations and molecular underpinnings of complex and rare diseases
  I am excited by big, complex and messy data that ends up into beautiful and meaningful visualizations that help us derive actionable insights and new hypotheses for the acceleration of translational and precision medicine
