  I am a Bioinformatician and Data Science professional with over 15 years of extensive experience in Computing, including 5 years of experience 
  in big and complex data analytics, management and visualization. I am proficient in data processing, modeling, analysis, visualization, and 
  building innovative data-driven tools and systems to solve complex problems in diverse domains. I am also keen at leveraging cutting-edge technologies to 
  support the elucidation and discovery of hidden patterns, and unknown correlations in big data, towards translating business requirements into substantial deliverables.
  
  Iâ€™m interested in developing computational tools and applying statistical methods, and cutting-edge technologies 
  (including machine learning and artificial intelligence) for integrating, managing and analyzing big and high-dimensional 
  data to unravel true associations and data. 
  I am excited by big, complex and messy data that ends up into beautiful and meaningful visualizations that help 
  us derive actionable insights and new hypotheses from data.

  I have experience in the analysis of high-throughput next-generation sequencing (NGS) data, Standard NGS bioinformatics toolsets, 
  High-Performance Computing Systems, Shell Scripting, R and R Studio, Python, Machine Learning, Dash and Plotly, 
  C++, Java, GitHub, Git version control, and Database Development and management.
