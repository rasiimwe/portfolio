## Sample Projects:

#### [Project 1: Whole genome profiling to derive insights into the underpinnings of triple negative breast cancer and its treatment](https://open.library.ubc.ca/media/stream/pdf/24/1.0377717/4)

This research project was aimed at developing, optimizing and utilizing a database-driven approach to integrate, store, query, statistically analyze and visualize largescale whole genome profiling data from tumors of breast cancer patients and to support inference of patterns of mutations and genomic events underpinning a patient‚Äôs disease while providing an in-depth understanding and elucidation of the landscape of mutations occurring in patient genomes that may reflect specific mutational processes as targetable vulnerabilities in treatment of human cancers.

#### [Project 2: Understanding tissue-specific temporal changes after SIV infection to guide HIV treatment](https://github.com/rasiimwe/Galaxy_Transcriptomics)

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has continued to be a public health issue on a global scale and over 35 million people have died due to the onset of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related diseases. Early diagnosis is crucial as it enables the control of infection via antiretroviral therapy in addition to reducing the risk of transmission, however, it is estimated that half of the patients with HIV worldwide are ‚Äúlate-presenters‚Äù due to the asymptomatic nature of the virus; a rationale for which more knowledge is needed to understand the early stages of HIV infection, and immune response. Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), a retrovirus infecting nonhuman primates, has similar symptoms and viral life cycle to that of HIV. Phylogenetic analysis also shows that SIV and HIV are ancestrally related and are closely related in viral replication and propagation, making it a good model to understand early development of infection. This project aimed at evaluating tissue-specific transcriptomic changes in the first ten days after SIV infection in rhesus monkeys. We found that significant transcriptomic changes occur as early as day 1 post infection throughout host tissues. This knowledge is crucial for development of treatment as well as vaccines and more effective post-exposure prophylaxis drugs.

#### [Project 3: Database design, development and optimization](https://open.library.ubc.ca/media/stream/pdf/24/1.0377717/4)

Experience with database design, development, optimization and administration. I have worked with Microsoft Access, Oracle, MySQL and PostgreSQL.

#### Project 4: Shiny Apps and Dashboards

I have developed quite a number of Shiny-based tools, apps and/dashboards, most of which are internal to the institutions I have worked with. Below are some of the few examples that are public. I have also had a brash with visualizations using Dash Python.

Not accessible publicly, but this app can be viewed in my [thesis (pages 75 - 87)](https://open.library.ubc.ca/media/stream/pdf/24/1.0377717/4)

#### [Project 5: DNA methylation and Genotyping Data Analyses](https://assets.researchsquare.com/files/rs-764250/v1_covered.pdf?c=1628604236)

Provided is an overview of extracts from developed data [preprocessing pipelines](https://github.com/rasiimwe/Code_Examples/blob/main/DNAme%20preprocessing.Rmd) and up/downstream analyses on various projects (some ongoing). Some of the images shown are extracts from upstream analyses required to preprocess data for studies such as those conducted in this [manuscript](https://assets.researchsquare.com/files/rs-764250/v1_covered.pdf?c=1628604236). Similar projects I have conducted on DNA methylation and genotyping analyses follow somewhat similar pipelines and analyses - some soon to be published and released into the public domain as well.
