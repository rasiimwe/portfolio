## Sample Projects:

#### [Project 1: Whole genome profiling for stratifying and deriving insights into the underpinnings and treatment of triple negative breast cancer](https://open.library.ubc.ca/media/stream/pdf/24/1.0377717/4)

This research project was aimed at developing, optimizing and utilizing a database-driven approach to integrate, store, query, statistically analyze and visualize large-scale whole genome profiling data from tumors of breast cancer patients to support inferences of the genomic events underpinning a patient’s disease while providing an in-depth understanding and elucidation of the landscape of mutations occurring in patient genomes that may reflect specific mutational processes as targetable vulnerabilities in the treatment of this, and other human cancers. Please see [publication](https://open.library.ubc.ca/media/stream/pdf/24/1.0377717/4) for details on methods applied for this project.

#### [Project 2: Understanding tissue-specific temporal changes after SIV infection to guide HIV treatment](https://github.com/rasiimwe/Galaxy_Transcriptomics)

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has continued to be a public health issue on a global scale and over 35 million people have died due to the onset of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related diseases. Early diagnosis is crucial as it enables the control of infection via antiretroviral therapy in addition to reducing the risk of transmission, however, it is estimated that half of the patients with HIV worldwide are “late-presenters” because of the asymptomatic nature of the virus; a rationale for which more knowledge is needed to understand the early stages of HIV infection, and immune response. Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), a retrovirus infecting nonhuman primates, has similar symptoms and viral life cycle to that of HIV. Phylogenetic analysis also shows that SIV and HIV are ancestrally related and are closely related in viral replication and propagation, making it a good model for understanding early development of infection. This project aimed at evaluating tissue-specific transcriptomic changes in the first ten days after SIV infection in rhesus monkeys. We leveraged various statistical methods such as fitting linear models, cluster analysis, PCA, gene enrichment and pathway analysis, using various CRAN/Bioconductor R packages, and found that significant transcriptomic changes occur as early as day 1 post infection throughout host tissues. This knowledge is crucial for development of treatment as well as vaccines and more effective post-exposure prophylaxis drugs. Please visit the [GitHub project repo](https://github.com/rasiimwe/Galaxy_Transcriptomics/blob/main/README.md) for more details.

#### [Project 3: Database design, development and optimization](https://open.library.ubc.ca/media/stream/pdf/24/1.0377717/4)

Experience with database design, development, optimization and administration. I have worked with Microsoft Access, Oracle, MySQL and PostgreSQL Database Management Systems (DBMSs).

#### [Project 4: DNA methylation and Genotyping Data Analyses](https://assets.researchsquare.com/files/rs-764250/v1_covered.pdf?c=1628604236)

Provided below is an overview of extracts from developed data preprocessing pipelines and up/downstream analyses on various projects (some ongoing). The images shown are extracts from either up/downstream project data analyses such as those conducted in this [manuscript](https://assets.researchsquare.com/files/rs-764250/v1_covered.pdf?c=1628604236). Similar projects I have conducted in this domain (DNA methylation and genotyping) follow similar pipelines and analyses - some soon to be published and released into the public domain as well.

#### [Project 5: Using Machine Learning to Predict Breast Cancer](https://github.com/rasiimwe/Code_Examples/blob/main/Predicting_Breast_Cancer_Using_Machine_Learning.ipynb)

This project utilizes the [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29) for predictive analysis in breast cancer. Key tools largely used include: Jupyter Notebook, Python - numpy, pandas, matplotlib, plotly, seaborn and scikit-learn and plotly to run and compare Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNeighbors, SVC, DecisionTree, GradientBoosting, AdaBoost, and XGB classification models.

#### Project 6: Shiny Apps and Dashboards

I have developed a number of Shiny-based tools, apps and/dashboards, most of which are internal to the institutions I have worked with. Below are some of the few examples that are public. I have also had some experience conducting data analysis and visualizations using Dash (Python).

Not accessible publicly, but this app can be viewed in my [thesis (pages 75 - 87)](https://open.library.ubc.ca/media/stream/pdf/24/1.0377717/4)

[<img src="images/Shinyapp1.png?raw=true"/>](https://open.library.ubc.ca/media/stream/pdf/24/1.0377717/4)

Below is another tool that is under development.  It compares DNA methylation patterns in immune cell types between cord and adult blood:

<!--- 
Developed for training purposes, this is an elementary [dashboard](https://rasiimwe.shinyapps.io/NHS_A_and_E_Example_App/) that utilises a subset of the NHS England A&E (Accident and Emergency) dataset, and shows the weekly and monthly attendances and emergency admissions in a specified period for all A&E types.
